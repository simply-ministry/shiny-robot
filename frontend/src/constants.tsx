Yet, from the smoldering ashes, she was reborn, her body and soul fused with the undying essence of a Phoenix. Now, she seeks to master her volatile gift, driven by the guilt of her past and a fierce, protective instinct to prevent such destruction from ever happening again.",

Her personal mission is to rescue her husband and child, who were lost to the Void.",
backstory: "A renowned xenolinguist, Sky.ix dedicated her life to understanding the language of the cosmos alongside her husband, Otis, at the Onalym Nexus research outpost. Her life was one of discovery and family, raising her son Micah amidst the stars. During the cataclysmic Onalym Nexus onslaught, a Void rift tore through their home. To save Micah, Sky.ix forced him into an escape pod, but was pulled into the abyss herself. Instead of being erased, her cybernetic implants—designed for deep-space communication—were warped by the Void, fusing her with its reality-glitching nature. She escaped, but her memory of the event is fractured. She believes she was simply lost on a mission and that her family is waiting for her back home, unaware of the chaos that has consumed the Verse and the years that have passed.",

There, she discovered it was the source of her abilities. She learned to not only navigate this shared psychic realm but to shape it, turning her overwhelming empathy into a tool for control.
