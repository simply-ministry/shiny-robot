3.  **EVOLVE:** Players advance their characters by gaining experience, unlocking new skills in their unique skill trees, and acquiring powerful gear.

This blend of gritty, neon-soaked cyberpunk with grand, ethereal high fantasy is seen across the Verse.

- **Identity and Memory:** Otis/X's journey to reclaim his lost memories and discover his true self is a central theme, exploring whether we are defined by our past actions or our present choices.

- **"A Lion's Lament":** A quiet, dialogue-heavy scene where Aeron visits the ruins of his ancestral home, reflecting on his relationship with his brother, Kane.
