"""A high-level simulation of the game's software architecture.

This script provides a conceptual model of the game's various systems and
their interactions. It is not intended to be a functional application but
rather a design document in code form. The classes and methods defined here
represent the major components of the game engine, such as the physics
engine, combat system, and quest management.

The primary purpose of this file is to illustrate the relationships and data
flow between different parts of the game's architecture. It uses the Observer
design pattern to demonstrate how systems can communicate and respond to
events in a decoupled manner.
